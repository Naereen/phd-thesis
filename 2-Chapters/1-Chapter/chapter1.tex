\section{Overview of the contributions}
\label{sec:1:contributions}

We can list the following points to summarize the main contributions of this thesis:

\begin{itemize}
    \item
    We present the concepts and the notations of the multi-armed bandit problem in Chapter~\ref{chapter:2}, from a mathematical point-of-view.
    But we also follow a didactic approach as we use an online interactive demonstration designed to let anyone play against a small bandit problem from his/her browser, in Section~\ref{par:2:interactiveDemoDiscoverMAB}.

    \item
    We give a short literature review of stochastic bandit algorithms in Section~\ref{sec:2:famousMABalgorithms}.

    \item
    We present the problem of choosing which algorithm a practitioner should use, or algorithm selection from the rich collection of different MAB available, in Section~\ref{sec:2:chooseYourPreferredBanditAlgorithm}.
    We present an algorithm called \Aggr{} for aggregation of algorithms as an online solution to the algorithm selection problem, and numerical simulations to illustrate that it achieves state-of-the-art empirical performances
    \cite{Besson2018WCNC}.
    % with \textbf{Aggregator} (WCNC 2018)

    \item
    We wrote the most complete open-source simulation library for MAB problems, called SMPyBandits, which is published online under an open-source licence \cite{SMPyBandits,SMPyBanditsJMLR}.
    We present in details its architecture and its features in Chapter~\ref{chapter:3}, along with different examples of its usage.
    A full documentation is available online, as well as exhaustive instructions to reproduce the experiments used in the rest of this thesis.

    \item
    We propose different models for IoT networks, in Chapter~\ref{chapter:4}, where end-devices with cognitive radio capabilities can implement MAB algorithms on their side, to automatically increase their battery life and allow more devices to use the same network while maintaining a high Quality of Service
    \cite{Bonnefoi17,Besson2019WCNC,Bonnefoi2019WCNC}.
    % (CROWNCOM 2017, ICT demo 2018, WCNC 2019 and MOTIoN 2019)

    \item
    We implemented a proof-of-concept of the aforementioned model \cite{Besson2018ICT}, and we present it in details in Section~\ref{sec:4:gnuradio}. We made a video showcasing our demonstration, hosted at \texttt{\href{https://youtu.be/HospLNQhcMk}{youtu.be/HospLNQhcMk}}.

    \item
    The source code for the two previously mentioned contributions are all published online, along with clear instructions for reproducing our work.

    \item
    We formalize the multi-player bandit model, and we introduced three variants, in Chapter~\ref{chapter:5}.
    For the case with sensing information, we propose two new algorithms, and we give an analysis for our algorithm \MCTopM{} to show it is order-optimal,
    as well as extensive numerical experiments to demonstrate its good performance in comparison with the rest of the literature.
    Our work \cite{Besson2018ALT} also gave a new impulse on research on multi-player bandits, as some recent research works built up on our results.

    \item
    We also give a detailed literature review of the different extensions of the multi-player MAB model, which we believe was never written before.
    % were  (ALT 2018, and 4-8 works inspired by our article since then). State-of-the-art with our algorithm MCTopM + klUCB for multi-player bandits "with sensing", empirical state-of-the-art with our simple (but wrong) "selfish" approach in case of "no sensing"

    \item
    We also present the piece-wise stationary MAB model, in Chapter~\ref{chapter:6}, and a detailed literature review of the research on non stationary MAB \cite{Besson2019GLRT,Besson2019Gretsi}.
    Following two recent works, we propose a new actively adaptive algorithm for the piece-wise stationary problem, \GLRklUCB, that achieves state-of-the-art performance.
    % - Literature review on non stationary models and algorithms, state-of-the-art for piece-wise stationary with our algorithm, GLR test + klUCB

    \item
    The last contribution of this thesis is a literature review of the possible use cases of the doubling trick technique for MAB problems,
    and a unified and more generic analysis of two families of doubling tricks.
    This lead to the article \cite{Besson2018DoublingTricks}, which is quickly presented in Appendix~\ref{app:2:DoublingTricks}, but not in the main text of the thesis.

    \label{fig:1:organization}
\end{figure}

The reading order of the manuscript can be any top-down path between the Introduction in the current Chapter~\ref{chapter:1}, and the Conclusion in the last Chapter~\ref{chapter:conclusion}. As the graph in Figure~\ref{fig:1:organization} shows,
the thesis is organized in two parts:

In Part~\ref{part:Introduction}, we start by the next Chapter~\ref{chapter:2} where we introduce the MAB models, the concepts and the notations used in all this document, and it is mandatory to read it.
Conversely, Chapter~\ref{chapter:3} presents our simulation library SMPyBandits, and even if Chapters~\ref{chapter:2}, \ref{chapter:5} and \ref{chapter:6} use the library for their numerical simulation, reading this chapter is not required to understand the rest of the document.

Then the second Part~\ref{part:MABIOT} contain three chapters, that are included in both the logical and chronological orders, but can be read almost independently.
Chapter~\ref{chapter:4} starts by presenting different models of IoT networks where MAB algorithms have been used with success. Our two models are interesting and close to reality, but they appeared to be too general to propose a mathematical analysis of the good empirical performance of the considered solutions.
For this reason, we weaken the models for the rest of the document,
and both Chapters~\ref{chapter:5} and \ref{chapter:6} studies an intermediate model, lying between the stationary single-player MAB model from Chapter~\ref{chapter:2} and the IoT networks models from Chapter~\ref{chapter:4}.
