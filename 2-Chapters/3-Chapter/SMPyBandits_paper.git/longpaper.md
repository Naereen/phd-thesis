# Summary

This article presents [my](https://perso.crans.org/besson/) numerical environment *SMPyBandits*, written in [Python (2 or 3)](https://www.python.org/) [@python], for numerical simulations on *single*-player and *multi*-players [Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit) algorithms [@Bubeck12].

*SMPyBandits* is the most complete open-source implementation of state-of-the-art algorithms tackling various kinds of sequential learning problems referred to as Multi-Armed Bandits.
It aims at being extensive, simple to use and maintain, with a clean and perfectly documented codebase. But most of all it allows fast prototyping of simulations and experiments, with an easy configuration system and command-line options to customize experiments while starting them (see below for an example).

*SMPyBandits* does not aim at being blazing fast or perfectly memory efficient, and comes with a pure Python implementation with no dependency except standard open-source Python packages.
Even if some critical parts are also available as a `C` Python extension, and even by using Numba [@numba] whenever it is possible, if simulation speed really matters, one should rather refer to less exhaustive but faster implementations, like for example [@TorLibbandit] in `C++` or [@VishMABjl] in Julia.

## Presentation

### Single-Player MAB
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problems are well-studied sequential decision making problems in which an agent repeatedly chooses an action (the "arm" of a one-armed bandit) in order to maximize some total reward [@Robbins52,LaiRobbins85]. Initial motivation for their study came from the modeling of clinical trials, as early as 1933 with the seminal work of Thompson  [@Thompson33]. In this example, arms correspond to different treatments with unknown, random effect. Since then, MAB models have been proved useful for many more applications, that range from cognitive radio [@Jouini09] to online content optimization (news article recommendation [@Li10], online advertising [@LiChapelle11] or A/B Testing [@Kaufmann14;Jamieson17]), or portfolio optimization [@Sani12].

This Python package is the most complete open-source implementation of single-player (classical) bandit algorithms ([over 65!](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.html)).
We use a well-designed hierarchical structure and [class inheritance scheme](https://smpybandits.github.io/uml_diagrams/README.html) to minimize redundancy in the codebase, and for instance the code specific to the UCB algorithm [@LaiRobbins85;@Auer02] is as short as this (and fully documented), by inheriting from the [`IndexPolicy`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.IndexPolicy.html) class:

```python
from numpy import sqrt, log
from .IndexPolicy import IndexPolicy

class UCB(IndexPolicy):
  """ The UCB policy for bounded bandits.
  Reference: [Lai & Robbins, 1985]. """

  def computeIndex(self, arm):
    r""" Compute the current index, at time t and
    after :math:`N_k(t)` pulls of arm k:

    .. math::

        I_k(t) = \frac{X_k(t)}{N_k(t)}
        + \sqrt{\frac{2 \log(t)}{N_k(t)}}.
    """
    if self.pulls[arm] < 1:  # forced exploration
      return float('+inf')   # in the first steps
    else:                    # or compute UCB index
      estimated_mean = (self.rewards[arm] / self.pulls[arm])
      exploration_bias = sqrt((2 * log(self.t)) / self.pulls[arm])
      return estimated_mean + exploration_bias
```

### Multi-Players MAB

For Cognitive Radio applications, a well-studied extension is to consider $M\geq2$ players, interacting on the *same* $K$ arms. Whenever two or more players select the same arm at the same time, they all suffer from a collision.
Different collision models has been proposed, and the simplest one consist in giving a $0$ reward to each colliding players.
Without any centralized supervision or coordination between players, they must learn to access the $M$ best resources (*i.e.*, arms with highest means) without collisions.

This package implements [all the collision models](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Environment.CollisionModels.html) found in the literature, as well as all the algorithms from the last 10 years or so (including [`rhoRand`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/PoliciesMultiPlayers.rhoRand.html) from 2009, [`MEGA`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.MEGA.html) from 2015, [`MusicalChair`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.MusicalChair.html) from 2016, and our state-of-the-art algorithms [`RandTopM`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/PoliciesMultiPlayers.RandTopM.html) and [`MCTopM`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/PoliciesMultiPlayers.MCTopM.html)) from [@BessonALT2018].

---


## Purpose

The main goal of this package is to implement [with the same API](https://smpybandits.github.io/API.html) most of the existing single- and multi-player multi-armed bandit algorithms.
Each algorithm comes with a clean documentation page, containing a reference to the research article(s) that introduced it, and with remarks on its numerical efficiency.

It is neither the first nor the only open-source implementation of multi-armed bandits algorithms, although one can notice the absence of any well-maintained reference implementation.
I built *SMPyBandits* from a framework called *pymaBandits* [@pymaBandits], which implemented a few algorithms and three kinds of arms, in both Python and MATLAB.
The goal was twofolds, first to implement as many algorithms as possible to have a complete implementation of the current state of research in MAB, and second to implement multi-players simulations with different models.

Since November $2016$, I follow actively the latest publications related to Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) research, and usually I implement quickly any new algorithms. For instance, [Exp3++](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.Exp3PlusPlus.html), [CORRAL](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.CORRAL.html) and [SparseUCB](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.SparseUCB.html) were each introduced by articles ([for Exp3++](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.06103), [for CORRAL](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06246v2), [for SparseUCB](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01383)) presented at COLT in July 2017, [LearnExp](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.LearnExp.html) comes from a [NIPS 2017 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04825), and [kl-UCB++](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.klUCBPlusPlus.html) from an [ALT 2017 paper](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01475078).

## Features

With this numerical framework, simulations can run on a single CPU or a multi-core machine using joblib [@joblib],
and summary plots are automatically saved as high-quality PNG, PDF and EPS (ready for being used in research article), using matplotlib [@matplotlib] and seaborn [@seaborn].
Making new simulations is very easy, one only needs to write a configuration script and no knowledge of the internal code architecture.

### Examples of configuration for some simulations

A small script [`configuration.py`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/configuration.html) is used to import the [arm classes](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Arms.html), the [policy classes](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.html) and define the problems and the experiments.
For instance, we can compare the standard anytime [`klUCB`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.klUCB.html) algorithm against the non-anytime variant [`klUCBPlusPlus`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.klUCBPlusPlus.html) algorithm, as well as [`UCB`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.UCBalpha.html) (with $\alpha=1$) and [`Thompson`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.Thompson.html) (with [Beta posterior](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.Posterior.Beta.html)).
See below in Figure \ref{fig:plot1} for the result showing the average regret for these $4$ algorithms.

```python
from Arms import *;  from Policies import *

configuration = {
  "horizon": 10000,     # Finite horizon of the simulation
  "repetitions": 1000,  # Number of repetitions
  "n_jobs": -1,         # Max number of cores for parallelization
  # Environment configuration, you can set up more than one.
  "environment": [ {
      "arm_type": Bernoulli,
      "params": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9]
  }],
  # Policies that should be simulated, and their parameters.
  "policies": [
      {"archtype": klUCB, "params": {} },
      {"archtype": klUCBPlusPlus,
       "params": { "horizon": 10000 } },
      {"archtype": UCBalpha,
       "params": { "alpha": 1 } },
      {"archtype": Thompson, "params": {} },
  ]}
```

For a second example, this snippet is a minimal example [^confmultiplayers] of configuration for multiplayer simulations, comparing different multi-player algorithms used with the [`klUCB`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.klUCB.html) index policy.
See below in Figure \ref{fig:plot2} for an illustration.

[^confmultiplayers]:  See the file [`configuration_multiplayers.py`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/configuration_multiplayers.html) in the code for more details.

```python
from Arms import *;  from Policies import *
from PoliciesMultiPlayers import *
nbPlayers = 3

configuration = {
  "horizon": 10000,    # Finite horizon of the simulation
  "repetitions": 100,  # Number of repetitions
  "n_jobs": -1,        # Max number of cores for parallelization
  # Environment configuration, you can set up more than one.
  "environment": [ {
      "arm_type": Bernoulli,
      "params": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9]
  } ],
  # Policies that should be simulated, and their parameters.
  "successive_players": [
      CentralizedMultiplePlay(nbPlayers, nbArms, klUCB).children,
      RandTopM(nbPlayers, nbArms, klUCB).children,
      MCTopM(nbPlayers, nbArms, klUCB).children,
      Selfish(nbPlayers, nbArms, klUCB).children,
      rhoRand(nbPlayers, nbArms, klUCB).children,
  ] }
```

### Documentation

A complete sphinx [@sphinx] documentation for each algorithms and every piece of code, included the constants in the different configuration files, is available here: [`https://smpybandits.github.io`](https://smpybandits.github.io/).

### Other noticeable features

#### [Single-player Policies](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.html)

- More than 65 algorithms, including all known variants of the [`UCB`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.UCB.html), [kl-UCB](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.klUCB.html), [`MOSS`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.MOSS.html) and [Thompson Sampling](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.Thompson.html) algorithms, as well as other less known algorithms ([`OCUCB`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.OCUCB.html), [`BESA`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.OCUCB.html), [`OSSB`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.OSSB.html) etc).
- Implementation of very recent Multi-Armed Bandits algorithms, e.g., [`kl-UCB++`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.klUCBPlusPlus.html), [`UCB-dagger`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.UCBdagger.html),  or [`MOSS-anytime`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.MOSSAnytime.html) (from [this COLT 2016 article](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/degenne16.pdf)).
- Experimental policies: [`BlackBoxOpt`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.BlackBoxOpt.html) or [`UnsupervisedLearning`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.UnsupervisedLearning.html) (using Gaussian processes to learn the arms distributions).

#### Arms and problems
- The framework mainly targets stochastic bandits, with arms following [`Bernoulli`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Arms/Bernoulli.html), bounded (truncated) or unbounded [`Gaussian`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Arms/Gaussian.html), [`Exponential`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Arms/Exponential.html), [`Gamma`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Arms/Gamma.html) or [`Poisson`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Arms/Poisson.html) distributions.
- The default configuration is to use a fixed problem for N repetitions (e.g. 1000 repetitions, use [`MAB.MAB`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Environment/MAB.html)), but there is also a perfect support for "Bayesian" problems where the mean vector $\mu_1,\dots,\mu_K$ change *at every repetition* (see [`MAB.DynamicMAB`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Environment/MAB.html)).
- There is also a good support for Markovian problems, see [`MAB.MarkovianMAB`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Environment/MAB.html), even though I preferred to not implement policies specifically designed for Markovian problems.

---

## Other remarks
- The framework is implemented in an imperative and object oriented style. Algorithm and arms are represented as classes, and the API of the `Arms`, `Policy` and `MultiPlayersPolicy` classes is [clearly documented](https://smpybandits.github.io/API.html).
- The code is [clean](https://smpybandits.github.io/logs/main_pylint_log.txt), and a special care is given to keep it compatible for both [Python 2](https://smpybandits.github.io/logs/main_pylint_log.txt) and [Python 3](https://smpybandits.github.io/logs/main_pylint3_log.txt).
- The joblib library [@joblib] is used for the [`Evaluator`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Environment.Evaluator.html) classes, so the simulations are easily ran in parallel on multi-core machines and servers [^nogpu].

[^nogpu]:  Note that *SMPyBandits* does no need a GPU and is not optimized to run on a cluster. In particular, it does not take advantage of popular libraries like [numexpr](https://github.com/pydata/numexpr), [theano](http://www.deeplearning.net/software/theano/) or [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

### How to run the experiments ?

For example, this short bash snippet [^docforconf] shows how to clone the code, install the requirements for Python 3 (in a virtualenv [@virtualenv]), and starts some simulation for $N=1000$ repetitions of the default non-Bayesian Bernoulli-distributed problem, for $K=9$ arms, an horizon of $T=10000$ and on $4$ CPUs [^speedofsimu].
Using environment variables (`N=1000`) when launching the simulation is not required but it is convenient.

[^docforconf]:  See [this page of the documentation](https://smpybandits.github.io/How_to_run_the_code.html) for more details.
[^speedofsimu]:  It takes about $20$ to $40$ minutes for each simulation, on a standard $4$-cores $64$ bits GNU/Linux laptop.

```bash
# 1. get the code in /tmp/, or wherever you want
cd /tmp/
git clone https://GitHub.com/SMPyBandits/SMPyBandits.git
cd SMPyBandits.git
# 2. just be sure you have the latest virtualenv from Python 3
sudo pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
# 3. create and active the virtualenv
virtualenv3 venv || virtualenv venv
. venv/bin/activate
# 4. install the requirements in the virtualenv
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
# 5. run a single-player simulation!
N=1000 T=10000 K=9 N_JOBS=4 make single
# 6. run a multi-player simulation for 3 players!
N=1000 T=10000 M=3 K=9 N_JOBS=4 make moremulti
```

### Examples of illustrations
The two simulations above produce these plots showing the average cumulated regret [^regret] for each algorithm, which is the reference measure of efficiency for algorithms in the multi-armed bandits framework.

[^regret]:  The regret is the difference between the cumulated rewards of the best fixed-armed strategy (which is the oracle strategy for stationary bandits) and the cumulated rewards of the considered algorithms.

![Single-player simulation showing the regret of $4$ algorithms, and the asymptotic lower-bound from [@LaiRobbins85]. They all perform very well, and at finite time they are empirically *below* the asymptotic lower-bound.

## Research using *SMPyBandits*

*SMPyBandits* was used for the following research articles since $2017$ [^summaryphd]:

[^summaryphd]: [I (Lilian Besson)](http://perso.crans.org/besson/) have [started my PhD](http://perso.crans.org/besson/phd/) in October $2016$, and this is a part of my **on going** research since December $2016$. I launched the [documentation](https://smpybandits.github.io/) on March $2017$, I wrote my first research articles using this framework in $2017$ and I was finally able to open-source my project in February $2018$.

- For this first article, [@Bonnefoi17], *SMPyBandits* was not used to generate the main figures, but to explore on a smaller scale many other approaches (using [`EvaluatorSparseMultiPlayers`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Environment.EvaluatorSparseMultiPlayers.html)).

- For [@BessonALT2018], we used *SMPyBandits* for all the simulations for multi-player bandit algorithms [^article1]. We designed the two [`RandTopM`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/PoliciesMultiPlayers.RandTopM.html) and [`MCTopM`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/PoliciesMultiPlayers.MCTopM.html) algorithms and proved than they enjoy logarithmic regret in the usual setting, and outperform significantly the previous state-of-the-art solutions (*i.e.*, [`rhoRand`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/PoliciesMultiPlayers.rhoRand.html), [`MEGA`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.MEGA.html) and [`MusicalChair`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.MusicalChair.html)).

[^article1]:  More details and illustrations are given on the documentation page, [`MultiPlayers`](https://smpybandits.github.io/MultiPlayers.html).

- In [@BessonWCNC2018], we used *SMPyBandits* to illustrate and compare different aggregation algorithms [^article2]. We designed a variant of the Exp3 algorithm for online aggregation of experts [@Bubeck12], called [`Aggregator`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.Aggregator.html). Aggregating experts is a well-studied idea in sequential learning and in machine learning in general. We showed that it can be used in practice to select on the run the best bandit algorithm for a certain problem from a fixed pool of experts. This idea and algorithm can have interesting impact for Opportunistic Spectrum Access applications [@Jouini09] that use multi-armed bandits algorithms for sequential learning and network efficiency optimization.

[^article2]:  More details and illustrations are given on the documentation page, [`Aggregation`](https://smpybandits.github.io/Aggregation.html).

- In [@Besson2018c], we used *SMPyBandits* to illustrate and compare different "doubling trick" schemes [^article3]. In sequential learning, an algorithm is *anytime* if it does not need to know the horizon $T$ of the experiments. A well-known trick for transforming any non-anytime algorithm to an anytime variant is the "Doubling Trick": start with an horizon $T_0\in\mathbb{N}$, and when $t > T_i$, use $T_{i+1} = 2 T_i$. We studied two generic sequences of growing horizons (geometric and exponential), and we proved two theorems that generalized previous results. A geometric sequence suffices to minimax regret bounds (in $R_T = \mathcal{O}(\sqrt(T))$), with a constant multiplicative loss $\ell \leq 4$, but cannot be used to conserve a logarithmic regret bound (in $R_T = \mathcal{O}(\log(T))$). And an exponential sequence can be used to conserve logarithmic bounds, with a constant multiplicative loss also $\ell \leq 4$ in the usual setting. It is still an open question to know if a well-tuned exponential sequence can conserve minimax bounds or weak minimax bounds (in $R_T = \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log(T)})$).

[^article3]:  More details and illustrations are given on the documentation page, [`DoublingTrick`](https://smpybandits.github.io/DoublingTrick.html).


## Dependencies
The framework is written in Python [@python], using matplotlib [@matplotlib] for 2D plotting, numpy [@numpy] for data storing, random number generations and and operations on arrays, scipy [@scipy] for statistical and special functions, and seaborn [@seaborn] for pretty plotting and colorblind-aware colormaps.
Optional dependencies include joblib [@joblib] for parallel simulations, numba [@numba] for automatic speed-up on some small functions, as well as sphinx [@sphinx] for generating the documentations.
I also acknowledge the use of virtualenv [@virtualenv] for launching simulations in isolated environments, and jupyter [@jupyter] used with ipython [@ipython] to experiment with the code.
