ABSTRACT="We implement an IoT network the following way: one gateway, one or several
intelligent (ie, learning) objects, embedding the proposed solution, and a
traffic generator that emulates radio interferences from many other
objects. Intelligent objects communicate with the gateway with a wireless
ALOHA-based protocol, which does not require any specific overhead for the
learning. We model the network access as a discrete sequential decision
making problem, and using the framework and algorithms from Multi-Arm
Bandit (MAB) learning, we show that intelligent objects can improve their
access to the network by using low complexity and decentralized algorithms,
such as UCB and Thompson Sampling. This solution could be added in a
straightforward and costless manner in LoRaWAN networks, just by adding
this feature in some or all the devices, without any modification on
network side."
