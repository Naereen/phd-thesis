For the curious reader, we wanted to include here an illustration and a description of the three components of the demonstration we presented above in Section~\ref{sec:4:gnuradio}.
%
The code corresponding to the following components is written in \texttt{C++} and \texttt{Python} for the hand-written blocks, and using the GUI of the GNU Radio Companion software.
The flow-graphs are saved as XML files, and the complete code of our demo is fully available online, open-sourced under GPLv3 license, at

\subsubsection*{Random traffic generator}

Figure~\ref{fig:4app:USRP_TX_PU__v1__simple_grc} shows the \textbf{random traffic generator} flow-graph.
\texttt{Generator} is the only hand-written block, which is configured with a list of active channels, a list of occupancy rate, and constants about the PHY layer (preamble length and data length). It uses one USRP only for emitting data (``Sink'' mode).

\subsubsection*{IoT gateway}

The \textbf{IoT gateway} is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:4app:USRP_RX_BTS__v1__simple_grc} below.
%
We wrote the following blocks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    1) the \texttt{Demodulator} block, which is configured with a list of detection threshold (on the received power),
    \item
    2) the \texttt{Check\_ack} block, which is configured with a maximum block error and an accepted error rates (to decide when a message is close enough to an acknowledgement),
    \item
    and finally
    3) the \texttt{send\_ack} block, which is configured with the list of active channels, and knowledge about the PHY layer (delay before sending the Ack and its length).
\end{itemize}
All blocks need to know constants about the PHY layer (preamble length and data length). The IoT gateway uses one USRP for both emitting and receiving data (``Sink'' and ``Source'' modes).

\subsubsection*{IoT dynamic device}

Figure~\ref{fig:4app:USRP_TX_SU__v1__simple_grc} below shows the \textbf{IoT dynamic device} flow-graph.
The hand-written blocks are the
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    1) the \texttt{Renormalized\_ack} block, which is configured with the list of active channels and extra knowledge about the PHY layer (preamble length, message length, and a threshold to tune detection of the incoming Ack),
    \item
    2) the \texttt{Demodulator} and 3) the \texttt{Check\_ack} blocks, both shared with the IoT gateway,
    \item
    and finally 4) the \texttt{generator\_SU} block, which embeds the \UCB{} or Thompson Sampling algorithm, and which is configured with the list of active channels.
\end{itemize}
Most blocks need to know constants about the PHY layer (preamble length and data length). Any of the IoT dynamic devices use one USRP for both emitting and receiving data (``Sink'' and ``Source'' modes)
