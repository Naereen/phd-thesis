\chapter{More Efficient Spectrum Usage of IoT Networks with Selfish MAB Learning}
\label{chapter:4}
\minitoc

In this Chapter~\ref{chapter:4}, we present two models of Internet of Things networks, composed of many independent devices that are able to run MAB algorithm to learn and improve their access to the network.
The two models are presented mathematically, and numerical simulations justify the interest of the proposed algorithms.
We also present a proof-of-concept real-world validation of the advantage of using Multi-Armed Bandit algorithms for the first model, by showing and explaining a demonstration implemented on USRP \cite{USRPDocumentation} cards.

More precisely, on the one hand, we start by presenting in Section~\ref{sec:4:firstModel} a model where independent devices use an IoT network composed of different channels, used by static devices.
Devices do not use any sensing, but use acknowledgements sent by the Base Station to know if their communication messages were successfully received.
We consider the case when many independent ``dynamic'' devices all have a small probability of communicating at every discrete time. If they use simple MAB algorithms in a decentralized and independent fashion (what we call ``selfish'' learning),
we show in simulations that in the case of non-uniform repartition of static devices in the channels, the dynamic devices can improve a lot the network efficiency.
%
On a simple example, we present in Section~\ref{sec:4:gnuradio} a demonstration that implements and validates the proposed approach, using real radio hardware.

On the other hand, we present in Section~\ref{sec:4:retransmissions} a second model extending the first one, when devices can retransmit their messages for a fixed number of maximum retransmission (like in the ALOHA protocol).
In this second model, we compare different heuristic, all based on the UCB algorithm, and numerical simulation show that all the non-naive heuristics succeed in significantly improving the network efficiency.
